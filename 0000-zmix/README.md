# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Zmix is a library for expressing, constructing, and verifying non-interactive
zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). A broad class of zero-knowledge proofs is 
supported. Schnorr-type proofs are used for many parts and to glue pieces
together, while individual parts of a proof may use other zero-knowledge
techniques. There is a PoC [here](https://github.com/lovesh/ursa/blob/zmix/libzmix/src/zkl/sample_proof.rs) but this doc still needs alignment with the PoC. 

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Zero-knowledge proofs form a cryptographic building block with many 
applications. Within hyperledger, Indy relies heavily on ZKPs to construct
anonymous credentials. Fabric uses ZKPs to authenticate transactions when
using the identity mixer membership service provider. Implementing ZKPs
correctly however is challenging. Zmix aims to offer a secure
implementation of ZKPs which can be consumed through a simple API, making
it easier for other projects to use ZKPs.

## Introduction

A zero-knowledge proof enables a prover to convince a verifier of the truth
of some statement about certain values, without revealing those values. For
example, a prover may know that values `A` and `B` have an equal discrete
logarithm. That is, for some `x`, `A = g^x` and `B = h^x`. It could
convince a verifier that this is true by revealing `x`. If the prover would
rather not disclose `x`, it could instead construct a zero-knowledge proof
of this statement, and send the resulting proof to the verifier. The 
verifier can now be sure that `log_g(A) = log_h(B)`, without knowing the
discrete log `x`.

In the example above, there are three components: 

- What do we want to prove? That there exists an `x` such that `A = g^x`
and `B = h^x`.

- How do we know this is true? Because we know `x`.

- How can we prove it? With a zero-knowledge proof that the prover produces
and the verifier verifies.

In zmix, we have data types corresponding to these three components:

- `ProofSpec`: specifies what we want to prove

- `Witness`: contains the secrets that satisfy the `ProofSpec`.

- `Proof`: the zero-knowledge proof. 

The library provides two features: construction and verification of
zero-knowledge proofs. 

To construct a proof, zmix requires a `ProofSpec s` and a `Witness w`
(which is a valid witness for `p`), and will output a `Proof p`.  
To verify a proof, zmix requires a `ProofSpec s` and a `Proof p`, and will
output a boolean indicating whether the proof was valid (true) or invalid
(false).  
Typically a prover will be requested by a verifier to present a proof through
an artifact (Aries calls such an artifact a proof-request). The prover parses that 
artifact to create a <em>ProofSpec</em> which is then used (with a witness) to 
create a proof. The verifier will use the same process to create a <em>ProofSpec</em>.


# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

Conceptually, the zmix library will offer the functions:

* `generate_proof(s: ProofSpec, w: Witness) -> Result<Proof, Error>`
* `verify_proof(p: Proof, s: ProofSpec) -> Result<(), Error>`

where the 

1. proof specification `ProofSpec` contains a list of _statements_ `Statement`, where each statement represents a _part_ of the overall relation being proved
1. witness `Witness` contains the witnesses for the statements. Each `Statement` can have an associated `StatementWitness`. Witness for some statements might be derived from witnesses of other statements. 
1. proof `Proof` contains the proofs for the statements. Each `Statement` can have an associated `StatementProof`  however proofs for statements might be combined in a single `StatementProof`. Bulletproofs is an example where several proofs for statements like range proof, set membership, merkle tree membership etc are combined in a single proof. 

```
pub struct ProofSpec {
    statements: Vec<Statement>,
    ...
}

pub struct Witness {
    pub statement_witnesses: HashMap<usize, StatementWitness>,
}

pub struct Proof {
    // Keeping statement_proofs a vector and not a map of statement index -> Proof since several statements can have a single proof, like in case of bulletproofs
    pub statement_proofs: Vec<StatementProof>,
}
```
The library will offer and support various types of statements, such as signatures and commitments.
To combine and connect all the statements (i.e., the proof's parts) contained in the proof specification, that is, glue all parts together into a single zero-knowledge proof, the library will use _Schnorr proofs_.

For generating a Schnorr proof that encompasses multiple statements, for each statement one requires a _hash contribution_ on the one hand, and a _proof contribution_ based on an aggregation of the hash contributions on the other hand.
In particular, the library will implement a proof orchestrator that conceptually generates Schnorr proofs as follows:

![Generation flow](zmix_proof_generation.png)

For verifying such a Schnorr proof, one again requires (re-computed) hash contributions for each statement.
In particular, the library's proof orchestrator will conceptually verify a Schnorr proof as follows:

![Verification flow](zmix_proof_verification.png)

## Proof Modules

In accordance with the sequence diagrams shown previously, to (re-)generate the hash contributions and the proof contributions, the library will implement the following _proof module_ interface for each supported statement type:

```
pub trait ProofModule {
    fn get_hash_contribution(
        &mut self,
        witness: StatementWitness
    ) -> Result<Vec<u8>, ZkLangError>;
    fn get_proof_contribution(
        &mut self,
        challenge: &FieldElement,
    ) -> Result<StatementProof, ZkLangError>;
    fn verify_proof_contribution(
        &self,
        challenge: &FieldElement,
        proof: StatementProof,
    ) -> Result<bool, ZkLangError>;
}
```

## Referencing secrets by index

We previously described that the proof specification contains the number of secrets (called messages) involved in the proof as `message_count`, and a list of statements.
When generating and verifying a proof according to a proof spec, the number of secrets and the various statements are related in the following way:
assuming an ordered list of size `message_count` where each element represents some particular (unknown) secret involved in the proof, the statements can reference elements (that is, secrets) of that list by index.
If different statements reference the same index, they effectively reference the same secret.

To illustrate this, consider a statement type for signatures.
In general, signatures contain at least

1. a public key under which the signature can be verified, and
1. an *ordered* list of values that are either hidden (that is, secret) or
revealed (that is, public).

For example, the library will offer a statement type for Boneh Boyen
Shacham (BBS) signatures as follows:

```
pub enum Statement {
    PoKSignatureBBS(PoKSignatureBBS),
    ...
}

....
pub struct PoKSignatureBBS {
    pk: BBSVerkey,
    // Messages being revealed.
    revealed_messages: HashMap<usize, FieldElement>,
}
```

While each revealed value in the signature statement simply contains
the actual value, hidden values are qualified with an _index_.
In accordance with the list metaphor described above, this index must be smaller or equal to the overall number of secrets as specified in the field `message_count` in the proof specification.

### Referencing the same secret from different statements

The index-based approach allows for referring to the *same* secret in the
overall zero-knowledge proof from *different* statements. For example,
another important statement type are commitments, such as the following
Pederson commitment:
```
pub enum Statement {
    ...
    PedersenCommitment {
        message_index: usize,
        commitment: Vec<u8>,
        ...
    },
```
Consider a proof specification with a `message_count` of 2 and the
following two statements:
1. a `SignatureBBS` over three values where the first is hidden referring
to index 0, the second is hidden referring to index 1, and the third is the
revealed value 42, and
1. a `PedersenCommitment` referring (via `message_index`) to index 0.

The fact that both the signature and the commitment refer to index 0 means
that they both refer to the same secret in the overall list of secrets (of
size `message_count`) involved in the zero-knowledge proof.

### Expressing equality of secrets

The case when *different signature statements* reference the *same* index is special: this means that the underlying secret values in the signatures are *equal*.

## Supported statement types

Zmix plans to offer the following proof modules for the following statement types:

- Signatures
    - Boneh Boyen Shacham
    - Pointcheval Sanders
- Pedersen commitments
- Bulletproof intervals
- Bulletproof set membership inclusive and exclusive
- zk-SNARK set memberships
- Verifiable encryption
- Linkable indistinguisable tags (see ia.cr/2011/658) to realize scope pseudonyms

## Structures

### Statements

```rust
pub enum Statement {
    /// Boneh Boyen Shacham Signature
    SignatureBBS {
        pk: Vec<u8>,
        messages: Vec<HiddenOrRevealedValue>,
    },
    /// Pointcheval Sanders Signature
    SignaturePS {
        pk: Vec<u8>,
        messages: Vec<HiddenOrRevealedValue>,
    },
    PedersenCommitment {
        message_index: usize,
        commitment: Vec<u8>,
        params: PedersenCommitmentParams,
    },
    IntervalBulletproof {
        message_index: usize,
        min: Vec<u8>,
        max: Vec<u8>,
        params: Vec<u8>,
    },
    /// Camenisch Shoup Encryption
    EncryptionCS {
        message_index: usize,
        pk: Vec<u8>,
        ciphertext: Vec<u8>,
    },
    /// As defined by Bernhard et al., Anonymous attestation with user-controlled linkability (ia.cr/2011/658)
    LinkableIndistinguishableTagBLS {
        message_index: usize,
        tag: Vec<u8>,
        params: Vec<u8>,
    },
}

pub enum HiddenOrRevealedValue {
    HiddenValueIndex(usize),
    RevealedValue(Vec<u8>),
}

pub struct PedersenCommitmentParams(pub Vec<u8>);
```

### Proof Specification

The proof spec follows this data model
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct ProofSpec {
    #[serde(rename = "messageCount")]
    pub message_count: usize,
    pub statements: Vec<Statement>,
    pub params: ProofSpecParams,
}

pub enum ProofSpecParams {
    BN254,
    BLS12_381,
    Ed25519,
}
```

For example, a proof spec could be represented in JSON as
```json
{
  "messageCount": 2,
  "statements": [
    {
      "type": "SignatureBBS",
      "data": {
        "pk": [
          112,
          117,
          98,
          108,
          105,
          99,
          107,
          101,
          121
        ],
        "messages": [
          {
            "hiddenValueIndex": 0
          },
          {
            "revealedValue": [
              118,
              97,
              108,
              117,
              101
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "params": "BLS12_381"
}

```

### Witness
The witness follows this data model

```rust
/// A witness w is valid w.r.t. a proof specification s if
/// * w contains one value for each of the (hidden) messages in s, so w.messages.len() == s.message_count
/// * w contains one statement witness for each statement in s, so w.statement_witnesses.len() == s.statements.len()
/// * TODO: add further requirements
pub struct Witness {
    messages: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
    statement_witnesses: Vec<StatementWitness>,
}

pub enum StatementWitness {
    SignatureBBS(SignatureBBSWitness),
    SignaturePS(SignaturePSWitness),
    EncryptionCS(EncryptionCSWitness),
    PedersenCommitment(PedersenCommitmentWitness),
    IntervalBulletproof, // no witness data needed
    SetMembershipBulletProofMerkle(MerklePathWitness), 
    SetMembershipEccAccumulator(AccumulatorWitness),
}

pub struct SignatureBBSWitness {
    a: PointG1,
    e: FieldOrderElement,
    s: FieldOrderElement,
}
```

### Proof
The proof follows this data model
```rust
/// A proof p is valid w.r.t. a proof specification s if
/// * p contains one message s-value for each of the (hidden) messages in s, so p.message_s_values.len() == s.message_count
/// * p contains one statement proof for each statement in s, so p.statement_proofs.len() == s.statements.len()
/// * the type of p.statement_proofs[i] corresponds to the type of s.statements[i]
/// * TODO: add further requirements
pub struct Proof {
    // proof contains a single “challenge” value
    challenge_hash: Vec<u8>,
    message_s_values: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
    statement_proofs: Vec<StatementProof>,
}

pub enum StatementProof {
    SignatureBBS(SignatureBBSProof),
    SignaturePS(SignaturePSProof),
    EncryptionCS(EncryptionCSProof),
    PedersenCommitment(PedersenCommitmentProof),
    IntervalBulletproof(IntervalBulletproofProof),
}

pub struct SignatureBBSProof {
    a_prime: Vec<u8>,
    a_bar: Vec<u8>,
    b_prime: Vec<u8>,
    s_r2: Vec<u8>,
    s_r3: Vec<u8>,
    s_s_prime: Vec<u8>,
    s_e: Vec<u8>,
}

pub struct PedersenCommitmentProof {
    opening_s_val: Vec<u8>,
}
```
