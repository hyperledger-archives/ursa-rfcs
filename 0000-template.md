# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What is the unfulfilled requirement?  What use cases does
it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in Ursa and you were
teaching it to another Ursa programmer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how Ursa programmers should *think* about the feature, and how
  it should impact the way they use Ursa. It should explain the impact as
  concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or
  migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing
  Ursa programmers and new Ursa programmers.
- If applicable, describe any changes that may affect the security of
  communications or administration.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient
detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.
- Any new or altered interfaces should include pseudo-code.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and
explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
  choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
- For incorporating new protocol implementations what other implementations
  exist and why were they not selected?
- For new protocols, what related protocols exist and why do the not satisfy
  requirements?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have
  done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If
  you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed
  theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the
lessons from other distributed ledgers or cryptographic libraries and provide
readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.  

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process
  before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation
  of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  RFC?
